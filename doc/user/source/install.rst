Installation instructions
=========================

Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial
-------------------

A ppa-hosted binary installer is available for 16.04 Trusty, so
installation is as simple as:

::

   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:damjan-miklic-larics/assisi
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install assisi-arena-ui

The Xenial package is actively developed and maintained.
   
Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty (discontinued)
----------------------------------

A ppa-hosted binary installer is also available for 14.04
Trusty, so installation steps are the same as for Xenial. However,
this package is not being actively maintained any more. The last UI
release available for Trusty is 0.16.1.

Other platforms
---------------

On all other platforms, installation from source_ is currently the
only option.
